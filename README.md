# 2D-Array-Based-Connect-4
This Project allows the user to play Connect 4 with another player (in person, or they can just play with themselves) utilizing 2D arrays in Python. 

This project was one of my Freshman final projects where we were tasked to create a program with some requirements. 

One such requirement was to utilize Turtle for any purpose, I decided to utilize it's library to print if red or yellow wins, but it overall isn't that important to the program.

I will more than likely add more to this game (like maybe unique games I come up with) as I also want to make games in Python to demonstrate my Python abilities rather than having everything done in C++
